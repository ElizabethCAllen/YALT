      <h1>Common Interview Questions</h1>

      <p class="body-copy font-thin">
        If only you had a magic crystal ball that could look into the future and find out what interview questions will be asked for your next job opportunity! Or if you could read minds and know exactly what type of answers the interviewer is looking for. Unfortunately you, me, or anyone else can't have such super cool magic powers and we all just have to try our best with answering interview questions! We can't tell you the future, but we can tell you the most common questions that might be asked during an interview! 
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li class="list-item font-light">
         Can you tell me a little about yoursef?
         <ul class="details">
          This question is probably your first and best chance to pitch the interviwer on why you’re the right one for the job.
          Start with the present—where you are right now. Then, transition into the past—a little bit about the experiences you’ve had and the skills you gained at the previous position. Finally, finish with the future—why you are really excited for this particular opportunity.
         </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="list-item font-light">
            What do you know about the company?
            <ul class="details">
              Research your potential employers history! It is important to know about the company you are interviewing for. Research the company and show that you care and support their mission statement!
            </ul>
          </li>
        <li class="list-item font-light">
            Why do you want this job? 
            <ul class="details">
                Express enthusiasm, show that you are passionate about the job, and align your skills and experiences for the position. 
              </ul>
          </li>
            <li class="list-item font-light">
                Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
                <ul class="details">
                    This can feel like a bit of a trick question, because sometimes the answer is, “not in this job,” or, “in your job,” or something like, “at a bigger better opportunity elsewhere.” But none of those are things you actually want to say to an interviewer.
                    The best way to answer this question is to think about it like this: Think about where this position could realistically take you, and think about how that aligns with some of your broader professional goals.
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="list-item font-light">
                  What are your strengths and weaknesses? 
                  <ul class="details">
                     
When answering questions about your strengths and weaknesses, always keep the job description in mind. Remember that these questions are essentially the same from different angles: the employer wants to know that you have the skill set, experience, and attitude necessary to get the job done.

                    </ul>
                </li>
                
              <li class="list-item font-light">
                  Do you have any questions for us? 
                  <ul class="details">
                      No matter what, it is always important to ask at least one question at the end of the interview. It shows that you are really interested in the job and want to learn more. 
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
      </ol>

            You should think hard about how you can differentiate yourself from others -- every step of the way during the interview. Be memorable in a positive way even when answering these "boring questions." And, to be well-prepared to give smart answers! Remember, there is only one you and you are amazing!
