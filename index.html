    <h1>Banking</h1>

    <p>Step 1 : Write the date on the line in the upper right-hand corner. There will be a blank space next to or above the word "Date." Remember that a check is a legal document, and the date written here should always be the day that you sign the bottom of the check.
    </p>

    <p>Step 2: Write the name of the recipient. Write the name of the person or company you're sending the check to next to the line that says "Pay to the Order of." If it's a company and you're not sure exactly what it's called, make sure you get that information right before you write the check. You can also just pay the check to "Cash," but be careful, because that means that anyone can cash it.
     If it's to an individual, include both their first and last names. If they are a 'Jr.' or a 'Sr.' you should include this as well. If the check is going to an organization, write out its full name. Do not use acronyms unless explicitly given permission
