    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <p><b>Step 1 :</b>Write the date on the line in the upper right-hand corner. There will be a blank space next to or above the word "Date." Remember that a check is a legal document, and the date written here should always be the day that you sign the bottom of the check.
    </p>

    <p><b>Step 2:</b>Write the name of the recipient. Write the name of the person or company you're sending the check to next to the line that says "Pay to the Order of." If it's a company and you're not sure exactly what it's called, make sure you get that information right before you write the check. You can also just pay the check to "Cash," but be careful, because that means that anyone can cash it.
     If it's to an individual, include both their first and last names. If they are a 'Jr.' or a 'Sr.' you should include this as well. If the check is going to an organization, write out its full name. Do not use acronyms unless explicitly given permission
    </p>

    <p><b>Step 3:</b>Write the amount of the check to the right of the dollar sign. Write the exact amount, using dollars and cents. If the check is for one-hundred and twenty-five dollars with seventy-five cents, write "125.75".
    </p>

    <p><b>Step 4:</b>Write the monetary amount of the check in word form below the "Pay to the Order of" line. Make sure you also express the number of cents if there are cents, or write "even" at the end of the amount so that another person doesn't add more money to the amount. If you've written a check for $125.75, write  "one-hundred and twenty-five dollars and 75/100 cents,".
    </p>

    <p><b>Step 5:</b>Sign the check on the line in the bottom right corner. Your check will be invalid if it is not personally signed.
    </p>

    <p> <b>Step 6:</b>Fill out the memo section on the bottom left of the check. Though this part of the check is optional, it can be helpful to write a note to yourself or the recipient to remember what the check is for. You can write "For May rent" if you're sending a rent check. Also, many companies or landlords require that you provide some other information in the memo section; some companies require you to write your ID number in the "Memo" section, and if you're writing a rent check for your apartment, you should write the apartment # right in the memo section.
