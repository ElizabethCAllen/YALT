       Considerations for setting up your first bank accounts. The account you choose can help you ease into the habit of managing your own money and making good financial decisions while venturing out to the real world. Here’s a guide on how to open your first checking or savings account:
      <p class="body-copy font-thin">
        Figure out what you need: 
        When it comes to determining what accounts will work for you, review your needs. Are you looking for an easy way to access cash? Do you need a way to set money aside for longer-term savings goals? Also, consider the proximity and availability of your bank’s ATMs and branches, in addition to other personal preferences that may be important to you, like online banking and overdraft protection.
      </p>
      <p class="body-copy font-thin">
        The type of account you require will be based on your personal and financial needs and goals, so it’s important to know these before choosing your accounts.

        Consider your options. Once you’ve identified your needs, evaluate your options:
      </p>  
      <p class="body-copy font-thin">
        Checking account: A checking account can be opened individually or jointly, and you’ll need your basic information, Social Security number, driver’s license, and a minimum opening deposit amount. The account can usually be linked to a debit card – giving you quick access to cash – and can be managed online, as well as at ATMs. 
      </p>
      <p class="body-copy font-thin">
        Savings account: Similar to checking, you’ll need to choose between an individual or joint savings account, and be prepared with the same basic information and an opening deposit amount. With a savings account, the amount you deposit can actually grow based on the interest rate, allowing you to save even more for future financial goals.

        Once you’ve set up your accounts, review your options for monitoring and managing them. One way to keep tabs on the status of your accounts is with instant alerts sent right to your email or wireless device. By signing up for these notifications, you can be notified right away when a transaction takes place, allowing you to monitor your account activity wherever, whenever.
      </p>
      <p class="body-copy font-thin">

Online Banking gives you 24-7 access to all of your accounts with activity details, as well as various alerts you can choose from.
