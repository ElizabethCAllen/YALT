      <li class="list-item font-light"  id="pickingOutfood">How to pick out Fruit</li>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">With apricots and other stone fruits (peaches, plums,etc), the skin should be unbroken and evenly colored with no browned or mushy spots. Plums should be smooth-skinned. Give the fruit a very gentle squeeze. If it’s hard, the fruit will be tart and firm. If there is a little give, it is probably just ripened and sweet but firm. If the fruit is softer, it will be soft inside and very sweet.</p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Pears should be hard or very firm with no bruised spots. At home, they ripen very quickly, so don’t wait too long to use them.</p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Tomatoes should be brightly colored, slightly soft when squeezed, with shiny skins and no mushy spots.</p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Apples should be quite firm and evenly colored, with no gouges,cuts, holes, or brown or mushy spots.</p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Melons should be hard, heavy for their size, and for cantaloupes and honeydews, the navel spot should smell like a good ripe melon tastes. Watermelons should be shiny, clean, and golden on the bottom side. Thunk the melon with your finger.You want a melon with a medium pitch, not too deep (overripe) or too high (green).
            </p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Citrus fruit should be firm, with shiny, tight skins. When you squeeze it, it should seem full of juice. Fruit with thick skins is often old and dry.</p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Strawberries should be medium-sized and red, not large or yellow in places. Look at the bottom of the container to check for mold.</p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Cherries, raspberries, and blueberries from the supermarket are all pretty uniform in taste and quality. Home grown or freshly picked is always better, if you can get it.</p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Bananas are mostly a matter of personal taste. Green or freckled, it just depends on your preference.</p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Avocados are tricky. Green shiny ones might not be as perfect as they seem. A lot depends on when you are going to use the fruit and how. For guacamole you will make today, you want avocados that are soft but not mushy. If you buy hard ones, it won’t work. It doesn’t matter whether the outside is attractive, it only matters that, when you squeeze them ever so gently, the have a bit of give. If the little black button stem comes off easily, it’s ripe. Avocados will ripen in your non refrigerated fruit basket, but the rate of ripening is not 100 percent predictable. If you need them to be used in a fresh salad in three days, buy the ones that have only a little softness to them. If you need them in a week, go ahead and buy harder ones.</p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Grapes are a crap-shoot. What looks delectable can be sour and awful. It’s best to rely on a good local produce department to offer better grapes rather than just rolling the dice and hoping.</p>
         <p class="body-copy font-thin">Pineapples do not ripen after picking. A ripe pineapple’s stem end will smell sweet. Choose a pineapple that has a little give when you squeeze it, and one of the topmost leaves should come off with ease when you pull it gentle.</p>
      <li class="list-item font-light" id="pickingOutVeg">How to pick out vegetables</li>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Potatoes and other root vegetables, such as beets and carrots, should be hard, with no scars or gouge marks in the skin where processing machinery cut into the produce. There are several different colors of potatoes, carrots, beets, etc. The big brown potatoes called russets are for baking, and little potatoes are called new potatoes and are for mashed potatoes and other uses. Smaller potatoes should have smooth skins.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Celery should be light in color and very firm, with crisp, fresh leaves.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Asparagus should be small and very firm. It should have longer flexible spear tops and less inedible hard lower stems</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Onions come in different types. Spanish onions are reddish-purple and mild tasting. Sweet onions usually are more flat in shape and come in white and yellow varieties. The most commonly used kinds are globe yellow or white onions. Onions should be dry and very firm and heavy for their size. Avoid buying ones with black areas anywhere on the skin, because this is a mold that can make short work of your onion once it gets home. The flatter onions are usually sweeter and more aromatic. Green onions are baby onions with a unique flavor. The stalks should be firm and not floppy, and the bulbs at the bottom should be shiny, and feel tightly packed</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Corn on the cob should be just as fresh as possible. Look for full, heavy ears that have dry, brown silk on the ends. The kernels should be small, not large and coarse.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Cucumbers are best when small and fresh. Fresh cucumbers are firm like an apple and shiny. Smaller ones are sweeter and have fewer seeds.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Zucchini is a kind of squash. It’s green, with slightly fuzzy, mottled skin. Young, firm squash make the best eating. Good sliced in salads or sauteed with onions and garlic.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Summer squash or crookneck squash is a curved yellow squash with a thin, bright yellow skin. Young, very firm squash make the best eating.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Broccoli is a cluster of flowers. Old broccoli is floppy, bitter, and starting to bloom with yellow flowers. Good broccoli has tightly closed, dense heads and a deep blue-green color.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Cabbage should be brightly colored and quite firm and heavy. It is easily mistaken for lettuce, and visa versa, so make sure it's  cabbage that you are buying. </p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Lettuce comes in many kinds and colors. More nutritious types are brightly colored. Arugula and and some others can be slightly bitter, which works best when combined with other flavors. Lettuce should look clean and feel crispy, and have little to no discoloration from the natural colors. Iceberg lettuce is nearly nutrition-free. Look for firm heads that don’t have a browned stem. Butter lettuce is a soft, sweet variety that comes in rounded heads. Red and green leaf lettuces are longer leaved salad standards. Romaine is a leafy lettuce used in Caesar salad or to add crunch to a mixed greens bowl.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Fresh spinach should be tender, but not floppy, and bright green, not dulled to a waxy, tired-looking color.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Fresh green beans are often offered when they have passed their prime. Look for tender, moist-looking beans with a bright color. Avoid scarred, dulled beans. </p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Peppers should be very firm, not soft or wrinkled, and brightly colored. Green sweet Bell peppers ripen into yellow, orange, and red peppers. The only difference is the degree of ripeness.</p>
      <li class="list-item font-light" id="pickingOutOther">How to pick out non-plant produce</li>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Mushrooms should be dry, very firm, and evenly colored. Mushroom caps should be tightly closed, with no gills underneath exposed.Never slimy or soft and floppy.</p>

      <li class="list-item font-light" id="pickingOutMeat">How to choose cuts of meat</li>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">You can find a universe of wonderful recipes on the internet or in magazines or
          bookstores. Knowing how to choose the best ingredients is not usually included but is vital to success. The most common meats in the American diet are beef, chicken, pork, lamb, and seafood. When buying meat, remember that meat can always be contaminated.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Beef, lamb, or tuna can be eaten rare, but that does not apply to other meats, as
          a rule. Cook other processed meat well to prevent food-borne illness. You will need a meat thermometer.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin"> Processed meat is what is usually found at the grocery store. It arrives at the
          meat department sealed in plastic and is cut up and wrapped in the store. Sometimes a butcher shop or country store will have meat that is not processed in a factory. Sometimes a butcher shop has the same kind of meat found at the grocery store, however. You will just have to ask. In addition, the category of processed meat includes “lunch meats,” and meat found in frozen dinners, snacks, and ready-to-eat entrees. These industrial
          products may contain dyes, trimmings, undesirable parts of the animal, preservatives, MSG, salt water, soy, or pink slime. (See below.)</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">At the deli counter of your grocery store or in the meat department, look for meat
          that is shaped like a roast or natural cut of meat, not like a tube or oval. Look for natural muscle grain in the meat, and not a uniform texture that includes air bubbles. A lot of lunch meat is basically a cooked slop made of meaty bits, chemicals, salt, and water, with air whipped in to add volume. It’s more like a
          sponge than like meat. This piece will not even contemplate sausage.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Mass produced hamburger and beef-based processed meats may contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_slime"> “pink slime,”</a> which may contain ammonia. Pink slime is not allowed for human consumption in the EU and Canada, and for good reason.</p>

      <li class="list-item font-light" id="pickingOutBeef">How to choose cuts of Beef</li>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Tough cuts of meat are best prepared by stewing, pressure cooking, or other
          moist cooking method. Finer cuts can be roasted or broiled.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">A good cut of beef should be soft and pliable. Press on it with your fingertips to
          see if it has some give, like foam rubber or a pillow. If it’s harder, that means it
          has more connective tissue in it, which is what makes meat tough.</p>
        <p class="body-copy font-thin">Grain-fed beef is often thought superior to grass-fed beef. It has more fat
          marbled throughout and is less chewy, but grass-fed beef is leaner and more
          natural than grain-fed. Grass- fed cows walk around the pasture all day grazing,
          and although they develop stronger muscles, that means tougher meat.</p>
